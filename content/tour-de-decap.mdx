Join us on a scenic ride from Netlify CMS to its rebranded and enhanced version, Decap CMS. Netlify CMS has been a content management system for a while now – described super simply as: A content management system that gives users a simple way to manage their content on any site built with a static site generator (Gatsby, NextJS, Hugo).

## Why are we on a tour anyway?

Netlify open-sourced this cool little CMS which it made “for the community“, with that said, and like with any other open-source projects, there was an issue queue for bugs, improvements, and opportunities. We’re an open-source community right, so we help where we can to get a project as close to perfect as possible.

More users began to adopt the use of Netlify CMS as a simple solution to managing their site content which did cause some growing pains. As the user base grew, so did the need for more advanced features and customisation options.

To ensure the continued support, investment and maintenance this project deserved, Netlify transferred its ownership to one of its trusted partners. Users of Netlify CMS were assured everything would be okay by (Netlify themselves.)[https://www.netlify.com/blog/netlify-cms-to-become-decap-cms/]

> While this move may come as a surprise to some users, it's important to remember that it is part of Netlify's broader strategy to become an even more powerful and versatile platform. Users of Decap CMS can expect to enjoy the same high-quality product they've come to love, with even more investment and development.

## Transformation phase

Package names change.

(netlify-cms)[https://www.npmjs.com/package/netlify-cms] -> (decap-cms)[https://www.npmjs.com/package/decap-cms]

This project's official repository now becomes GitHub - (decaporg/decap-cms: A Git-based CMS for Static Site Generators)[https://github.com/decaporg/decap-cms]

This led to the evolution of the CMS into a sturdier and more adaptable platform, catering to a wider range of content management needs. You will now see a brand-new, shiny logo, but don't worry, everything else remains the same. The future of this project has become clearer, with improvements made and the support team comfortably in place.

Here are some community links to reiterate the above maintenance vision.
